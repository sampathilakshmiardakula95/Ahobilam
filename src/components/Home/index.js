          Ahobilam Temple is a very famous place of worship dedicated to the
          Narasimha Avatar of Lord Vishnu. Narasimha was the unique incarnation
          that Vishnu took to put an end to the ruthless demon Hiranyakashipu
          and, thus, save Hiranya-s son and Vishnu devotee Prahlada and the
          people, from the atrocities of the Rakshasa. As the name suggests,
          Nara Simha was the terrific form with a human body and a lion face and
          features, which the Lord took to circumvent the incredible boons that
          the demon obtained and overpower him. This temple is also known as
          Singavel Kundram, where -Singam- means lion in Tamil, and -Kundram- is
          a mountain. Ahobilam is a cluster of temples located in the mountain
          ranges of the Eastern Ghats in the Ahobilam village, Kurnool district,
          Andhra Pradesh. There are 9 temples for the various forms of
          Narasimha, spread within a circle of about 5 km, while there is also a
          temple for him as Prahlada Varada, at the foothills. Thus the temples
          are spread between the upper and lower Ahobilams. The Azhwar saints
          have sung the glory of this Lord in many of their hymns, and hence,
          this shrine is also regarded as a Divya Desam, a very sacred abode of
          Lord Vishnu. The pilgrimage to the Ahobilam temples is tough and often
          involves going on foot in arduous terrains.
          <br />
          Scriptures and legends regard Ahobilam, as the place where Vishnu took
          the mighty man-lion incarnation of Narasimha, to destroy demon
          Hiranyakashipu and protect Vishnu devotee, Prahlada. Narasimha is also
          said to have emerged from a pillar, which is believed to be a rock
          found here. Besides, Devas, the celestial beings were said to have
          been wonderstruck to see Narasimha, the terrific man-lion form, and
          exclaimed -Aho Bala,- that is, -what a might!- And so this place came
          to be called Aho Balam or Ahobilam. As per ancient texts like
          Brahmanda Purana, Garuda, the mighty bird mount of Vishnu did severe
          penance in these mountains for many years, to get the vision of the
          Narasimha form that destroyed Hiranya. At last, Garuda is said to have
          got the exhilarating darshan of Jwala Narasimha in all his glory, in a
          cave. The mountain range where Garuda performed the penance became
          Garudachala or Garudadri. As Garuda got Narasimha-s vision in a big
          cave, the place itself got the name -Aho Bilam,- the great cave.
          Senjulakshmi is the Lord-s consort here. Legends claim that Goddess
          Lakshmi was born as Senjulakshmi in the clan of the tribal hunters,
          here and married the Lord. It is also said Prahlada meditated here on
          the Lord for a long time, and that Narasimha taught him many Yogic
          feats.
          <br />
          The History and Architecture of Ahobilam Temple: <br />
          The 9 Narasimhas enshrined in the Ahobilam temples are â€“ the Jwala
          Narasimha, Ahobila Narasimha, Malola Narasimha, Kroda Narasimha,
          Karanja Narasimha, Bhargava Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha,
          Kshatravata Narasimha, and Pavana Narasimha. These deities can be
          worshipped in their individual temples, situated amidst the mountain
          ranges of Ahobilam. In addition to these, Narasimha, as Prahlada
          Varada can be worshipped in the main temple complex at the base of the
          mountains, at ground level. The festival deities of many of the hill
          temples are also housed here, due to security and other
          considerations. The temples built in the Dravidian style of
          architecture have been expanded, rebuilt and renovated principally by
          the Vijayanagara rulers, in the 15th and 16th century CE. Up in the
          mountainous region, there is a cleft of a massive rock, divided
          somewhat into 2 parts. This is known as the Ugra Sthambham and is
          believed to be the massive pillar of demon Hiranya-s palace, splitting
          which Lord Narasimha emerged out. Prahlada can also be worshipped in a
          cave not far from Ugra Sthambham along with Prahlada Narasimha Swamy.
          This shrine is called Prahlada Mettu. Raktha Kundam is the most sacred
          of the many water bodies of this place. It is said that Narasimha
          cleaned his blood-stained hands in these waters, after killing
          Hiranya, and that is the reason its waters are reddish in color, even
          now.
          <br />
          Temple Festivals : <br />
          Brahmotsavam is the important festival of this shrine, celebrated
          during the Tamil month Masi (February-March). Lord Prahlada Varada is
          taken in grand processions during this 10-day festival. Swati is the
          birth star of Narasimha, and on the Swati star days of every month,
          all the 9 Narasimha deities are given ceremonial sacred baths, known
          as Thirumanjanam.
          <br />
          Benefits of worshipping Ahobilam Lord Narasimha: <br />
          Narasimha is a powerful God, and Ahobilam is considered his place of
          advent. People seek refuge in him to ward off the negative impacts of
          the present difficult times of Kali Yuga. It is believed that he will
          help devotees gain courage, confidence, and strength, fulfill their
          honest wishes and grant them the boon of a happy, healthy, and
          contented life.
