      Ahobilam Temple is a very famous place of worship dedicated to the
      Narasimha Avatar of Lord Vishnu. Nara simha was the unique incarnation
      that Vishnu took to put an end to the ruthless demon Hiranyakashipu and,
      thus, save Hiranya-s son and Vishnu devotee Prahlada and the people, from
      the atrocities of the Rakshasa. As the name suggests, Narasimha was the
      terrific form with a human body and a lion face and features, which the
      Lord took to circumvent the incredible boons that the demon obtained and
      overpower him. This temple is also known as Singavel Kundram, where
      -Singam- means lion in Tamil, and -Kundram- is a mountain. Ahobilam is a
      cluster of temples located in the mountain ranges of the Eastern Ghats in
      the Ahobilam village, Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh. There are 9
      temples for the various forms of Narasimha, spread within a circle of
      about 5 km, while there is also a temple for him as Prahlada Varada, at
      the foothills. Thus the temples are spread between the upper and lower
      Ahobilams. The Azhwar saints have sung the glory of this Lord in many of
      their hymns, and hence, this shrine is also regarded as a Divya Desam, a
      very sacred abode of Lord Vishnu. The pilgrimage to the ahobilam temples
      is tough and often involves going on foot in arduous terrains.
      <br />
      Scriptures and legends regard Ahobilam, as the place where Vishnu took the
      mighty man-lion incarnation of Narasimha, to destroy demon Hiranyakashipu
      and protect Vishnu devotee, Prahlada. Narasimha is also said to have
      emerged from a pillar, which is believed to be a rock found here. Besides,
      Devas, the celestial beings were said to have been wonderstruck to see
      Narasimha, the terrific man-lion form, and exclaimed -Aho Bala,- that is,
      -what a might!- And so this place came to be called Aho Balam or Ahobilam.
      As per ancient texts like Brahmanda Purana, Garuda, the mighty bird mount
      of Vishnu did severe penance in these mountains for many years, to get the
      vision of the Narasimha form that destroyed Hiranya. At last, Garuda is
      said to have got the exhilarating darshan of Jwala Narasimha in all his
      glory, in a cave. The mountain range where Garuda performed the penance
      became Garudachala or Garudadri. As Garuda got Narasimha-s vision in a big
      cave, the place itself got the name Ahobilam the great cave. Senjulakshmi
      is the Lord-s consort here. Legends claim that Goddess Lakshmi was born as
      Senjulakshmi in the clan of the tribal hunters, here and married the Lord.
      It is also said Prahlada meditated here on the Lord for a long time, and
      that Narasimha taught him many Yogic feats.
      <br />
      The History and Architecture of Ahobilam Temple: <br />
      The 9 Narasimhas enshrined in the Ahobilam temples are â€“ the Jwala
      Narasimha, Ahobila Narasimha, Malola Narasimha, Kroda Narasimha, Karanja
      Narasimha, Bhargava Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Kshatravata Narasimha,
      and Pavana Narasimha. These deities can be worshipped in their individual
      temples, situated amidst the mountain ranges of Ahobilam. In addition to
      these, Narasimha, as Prahlada Varada can be worshipped in the main temple
      complex at the base of the mountains, at ground level. The festival
      deities of many of the hill temples are also housed here, due to security
      and other considerations. The temples built in the Dravidian style of
      architecture have been expanded, rebuilt and renovated principally by the
      Vijayanagara rulers, in the 15th and 16th century CE. Up in the
      mountainous region, there is a cleft of a massive rock, divided somewhat
      into 2 parts. This is known as the Ugra Sthambham and is believed to be
      the massive pillar of demon Hiranya-s palace, splitting which Lord
      Narasimha emerged out. Prahlada can also be worshipped in a cave not far
      from Ugra Sthambham along with Prahlada Narasimha Swamy. This shrine is
      called Prahlada Mettu. Raktha Kundam is the most sacred of the many water
      bodies of this place. It is said that Narasimha cleaned his blood-stained
      hands in these waters, after killing Hiranya, and that is the reason its
      waters are reddish in color, even now.
      <br />
      Temple Festivals:
      <br />
      Brahmotsavam is the important festival of this shrine, celebrated during
      the Tamil month Masi (February-March). Lord Prahlada Varada is taken in
      grand processions during this 10-day festival. Swati is the birth star of
      Narasimha, and on the Swati star days of every month, all the 9 Narasimha
      deities are given ceremonial sacred baths, known as Thirumanjanam.
      <br />
      Benefits of worshipping Ahobilam Lord Narasimha:
      <br />
      Narasimha is a powerful God, and Ahobilam is considered his place of
      advent. People seek refuge in him to ward off the negative impacts of the
      present difficult times of Kali Yuga. It is believed that he will help
      devotees gain courage, confidence, and strength, fulfill their honest
      wishes and grant them the boon of a happy, healthy, and contented life.
