            This shrine is inside a cave with a front mantapam. The Lord is Ugra
            Narasimha who is in a seated position, tearing the Asura
            (Hiranyakasipu) who is positioned in His lap. Worship of Jwala
            Narasimha is believed to result in the early marriage of the progeny
            of the devotee. It is also believed that lighting of lamps filled
            with ghee and worship offered with devotion here, especially in the
            month of Krithika would result in a life of glory now and liberation
            thereafter.Mars (Sukram) is stated to be worshipping in this shrine.
            <br />
            The temple of Jwala Nrisimha Swamy, lies higher up the above temple,
            on a hill called, -Achalachaya Meru-. This is about four kilometers
            from the Upper Ahobilam temple. This place is said to be the actual
            spot, where the fierce anger of the Lord reached its culmination
            when he tore Hiranyakasipu.

            so awe inspiring while coming out of the pillar that if “fear”
            itself was to take human form and see Him, it would be frightened.

            in the devotee and they are blessed by their ancestors for a
            harmonious life. Ahobila Narasimha is one of the 108 divyadesa
            deity. One of the Nava Gruhas, Jupiter (Guru) is worshipping the
